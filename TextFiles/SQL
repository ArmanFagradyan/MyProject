* SQL is a language used for interacting with Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)

    - SQL can be used for:
            1) Create, retrieve, update and delete data 
            2) Create & manage databases
            3) Design & create database tables
            4) Perform administration tasks (security, user management, import/export, etc.)

    - SQL implementations vary between systems
            1) Not all RDBMS follo the SQL standart to a 'T'
            2) The concepts are the same but the implementations may vary

    - SQL is actually a hybrid language, it's basically 4 types of languages in one 
            1) Data Query Language (DQL)
                * Used to query databases for information.
                * Get information that is already stored there. 
            2) Data Defenition Language (DDL)
                * Used for defining databases schemas.
            3) Data Control Language (DCL)
                * Used for controlling the access to the data in the database.
                * User & Permissions management.  
            4) Data Manipulation Languagge (DML)
                * Used for inserting, updating and deleting data from the databases. 

* QUERIES 

    - A query is a set of instructions given to the RDBMS (written in SQL) thath tell the RDBMS what information you want it to retrieve for you 
            1) Tons of data in a DB 
            2) Often hidden in a comples schema 
            3) Goal is to only get the data you need  

* Working

    - to create a database type "create database name;"
